ISS Observatory Game Website

Welcome to the ISS Observatory Game Website! This interactive platform lets users explore Earth through the eyes of astronauts aboard the International Space Station. Our 3D rotating globe features real NASA data, allowing visitors to observe natural disasters such as wildfires, tsunamis, floods, and sandstorms—all from a space perspective.

Our mission is to educate the public about Earth observation, inspire interest in science, and empower a new generation of problem solvers—supporting both global sustainability efforts and the UAE’s innovative vision for the future.
